This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.28.3.

Its purpose is to explore the complexity of migrating from an angular1 application to angular2.
It is based on the [angular1 app tutorial](https://github.com/angular/angular-phonecat) and
[angular1 app upgrade](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/upgrade.html#).

The application can be reviewed [here](https://ajaniv.github.io/angular2-explore-phone-catalog/).

## Documentation
The documentation was generated by running `compodoc -p src/tsconfig.json -d docs` 
and can be reviewed [here](https://ajaniv.github.io/angular2-explore-phone-catalog/).

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

Run `ng github-pages:deploy` to deploy to GitHub Pages.
